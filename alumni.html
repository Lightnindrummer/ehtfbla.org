FBLA taught me a new sense of professionalism, helped build my resume skills and made me stand apart compared to others. I will always remember the fun times we had at eht fbla and all of the memories. It completely transformed my high school experience and without joining the club, I wouldn’t have made the awesome friendships I did with other student and all the teachers. </p>

                        <p>My name is Tyler Weller, I was part of the graduating class of 2020. I was a part of the EHTHS FBLA club for my final 2 years of Highschool. My senior year I was the VP of competitive events and was given the responsibility of maintaining a very successful chapter that always has place winners at regions, SLC, and NLC.
                           My first year I competed in an open event at SLC and place first in the state. I then when to NLC in San Antonio Texas and competed. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Unfortunately my senior year was cut short due to COVID but I was able to compete at the SLC level through zoom.</p>

                        <p>I joined FBLA my sophomore year as a general member and soon realized that this club was a great place to surround myself with other ambitious and goal-driven students. Over the following three years I continued to become more involved in the organization. I first became a member of our local chapter’s membership committee and a member of the state’s community service committee as well. The following year I decided to run for our VP of Membership which allowed me to meet many new students and plan the annual induction dinner. I personally enjoyed the position due to the fact that I was able to share all of my positive experiences in FBLA to convince others to join and it forced me to stay organized when it came to managing new member information. I believe that this club is perfect for anyone who wants to get involved because it instills the importance of networking and professionalism at a young age.  </p>

For me FBLA allowed me to create life long memories and friendships. FBLA made high school so memorable from the field trips, State conferences, summits, nerfball planning, and traveling to different states for nationals! It also allowed me to experience new things with new friends and to become a better public speaker. </p>

                        <p>Hi!!! My name is Courtney Carmen and I currently attend the University of Alabama (Roll Tide!!) In high school, I was apart of the Academy of Law and Business, FBLA, and field hockey. During my time in FBLA, I started as a general member, then I was elected to Secretary, and later I was elected Co-President. I participated in 3 SLCs, placed in 2 of them, and 2 NLCs, one of which I placed 8th in the country. Doing these competitions seemed like a tough tasks, but once I started working with the advisors, it became easier and easier. Throughout my 3 years of FBLA, I learned many lessons that I still use today. One of the lessons is that you should never be afraid to ask for help. Your advisors and fellow members are there to help you and they serve as a great source of information. Another lesson that I learned is to get involved!! Wether it be with a project or running for an officer position, getting involved allows you to network and get comfortable with what you’re doing. In my opinion, joining FBLA was one of the best decisions that I ever made in high school.</p>
